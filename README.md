# CUTTING MAT BACKGOUND PICTURES

By Enno Hyttrek . Designer

A small collection of 100x100px tile images to create a cool and fancy cutting mat style desktop background on your computer that will make you look like a designer. Works with Windows and Mac OS (and probably Linux too, but has not been tested there).

Images included as JPG, PNG24 and PNG8. Please choose what suits you best (note: PNG8 should work fine on all current systems and put the least strain on your computer's memory -- however, the other two formats are only marginally harder to calculate for any modern machine, to be honest).
